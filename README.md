# Mental_Health_story_dashboard
I'm thrilled to unveil my dashboard using Tableau Public-A data visualisation and business intelligence tool!
Built an interactive dashboard in Tableau using Kaggle dataset on mental health risk factors. Analyzed data across Indian cities, focusing on students and professionals; applied filters &amp; story-building. Identified that Maharashtra contributes 5.71% of depression cases nationwide.
**Why this matters?**
In today's fast paced life,mental health is least taken care of,which requires the utmost priority.Hence the sample data so collected helps in bringing a little clarity to bring about the incentives and reforms accordingly.
